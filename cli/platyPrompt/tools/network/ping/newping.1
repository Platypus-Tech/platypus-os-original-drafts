.SH NAME
ping \- send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/ping
[
.B \-dfnqrvR
]
.I host
[
.I packetsize
[
.I count
[
.I preload
]]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The DARPA Internet is a large and complex aggregation of
network hardware, connected together by gateways.
Tracking a single-point hardware or software failure
can often be difficult.
.I Ping
utilizes the
ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an
ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.
ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header,
followed by a \fBstruct timeval\fR, and then an arbitrary number
of ``pad'' bytes used to fill out the packet.
Default datagram length is 64 bytes, but this may be changed
using the command-line option.
Other options are:
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose output.  ICMP packets other than ECHO RESPONSE that are received
are listed.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet output.  Nothing is displayed except the summary line on termination.
.TP
.B \-n
Numeric output only.  No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
names for host addresses.  Useful if your nameserver if flakey
or for hosts not in the database.
.TP
.B \-f
Flood ping.  Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hundred times
per second, whichever is more.  For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period '.'
is printed, while for ever ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed.
This provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped.
.TP
.B \-R
Record Route.  Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST
packet and displays the route buffer on returned packets.  Note that
the IP header is only large enough for six such routes.  Many hosts
ignore or discard this option.
.TP
.B \-r
Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached
network.
If the host is not on a directly-attached network,
an error is returned.
This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface
that has no route through it (e.g., after the interface was dropped by
.IR routed (8C)).
.TP
.B \-d
Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.
.PP
When using \fIping\fR for fault isolation,
it should first be run on the local
host, to verify that the local network interface is up and
running.
Then, hosts and gateways further and further away
should be ``pinged''.
\fIPing\fR sends one datagram per second, and
prints one line of output for every ECHO_RESPONSE returned.
No output is produced if there is no response.
If an optional
.I count
is given, only that number of requests is sent.
Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed.
When all responses have been received or the program times out (with a
.I count
specified),
or if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief
summary is displayed.
If
.I preload
is given,
.I ping
sends that many packets as fast as possible before
falling into its normal mode of behavior.
.PP
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement
and management.
It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation.
Because of the load it could impose on the network,
it is unwise to use
.I ping
during normal operations or from automated scripts.
.SH DETAILS
For those that care.  An IP header without options in 20 bytes.
An ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet contains an additional 8 bytes worth
of ICMP header followed by an arbitrary amount of data.  When a
.I packetsize
is given, this indicated the size of this extra blob of data (the
default is 56).  Thus the amount of data received inside of an IP
packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will always be 8 bytes more than
the requested data space (the ICMP header).
.PP
If the data space is at least eight bytes large,
.I ping
uses the first eight bytes of this space to include a timestamp which
it uses in the computation of round trip times.  This explains why if
less than eight bytes of pad are requested, no round trip times are given.
.SH BUGS
Far too many Hosts and Gateways (including the core gateways) ignore the
RECORD_ROUTE option.  To quote RFC 791, "What is optional is their
transmission in any particular datagram, not their implementation."
.PP
The maximum IP header length is too small for options like
RECORD_ROUTE to be completely useful.  There's not much that
we can do about that however.
.PP
Flood pinging the broadcast address is not recommended.
